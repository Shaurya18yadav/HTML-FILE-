                     <h2>The Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism[286] and later revolutionised in Sikhism.[287] It originated in the seventh-century south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards.[286] It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century.[288]</h2>

                     <li>The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, such as Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism.[289][290][291] The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta.</li>
                     <br><li>Sikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru,[294] and the ten successive Sikh gurus. After the death of the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, became the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal Guru, where the scripture's word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs</li>
                     <br><li>Buddhism in India flourished in the Himalayan kingdoms of Namgyal Kingdom in Ladakh, Sikkim Kingdom in Sikkim, and Chutia Kingdom in Arunachal Pradesh of the Late medieval period.</li>
